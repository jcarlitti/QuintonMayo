							<h2>About Quinton</h2>
							<p></p>
						</header>
						<p>&emsp;Quinton Mayo walked onto the campus of Randolph-Macon 
						College in 2015 with the intent to graduate in four years 
						with a degree in Computer Science. After one year of using 
						the lab computers to compare John Wall&apos;s prime to that of 
						hall-of-famer, Isiah Thomas, it was clear his heart wasn&apos;t 
						in PHP, Java, or HTML, but sports analysis.<br/>
						&emsp;Soon after, Quinton switched his major pursuit to Communication 
						Studies with a minor in Journalism -- a program that was 
						extremely underdeveloped at the school. With the goal of 
						proving to his parents, and himself, that a future in sports 
						television was the right move, Quinton worked tirelessly to 
						grow the journalism program at R-MC, maximize resources and 
						opportunities on the campus, and set himself up for a career 
						in the beloved field come graduation in May, 2019.<br/>

							margin-left:auto; display:block; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 30px;"/>
						<br/>&emsp;January 2017 marks the month in which Quinton started his 
						sports analysis youtube channel &quot;Mayo Please.&quot; 
						His first video was focused on breaking down the game of
						a young basketball prospect out of Salisbury, North Carolina 
						by the name of Zion Williamson. Quinton filmed, edited, 
						and published the video on YouTube -- 66,000+ views later, 
						he knew he had made the right decision. The sheer volume of 
						videos Quinton produced, while maintaining a 3.8+ GPA and 
						playing on the Yellow-Jackets football team, caused him to 
						come to a stark reality: &quot;If these are the results of my 
						efforts right now, with all these different things on my plate, 
						what would be the result of even more focus on developing as a sports analyst?&quot;<br/>
						&emsp;Quinton decided to step down from the R-MC football team 
						and fully commit any and all free time to the development 
						of his career path -- which really never felt like a &quot;career,&quot; 
						but genuine fun during spare time. He began working for the 
						R-MC Yellow Jacket school newspaper as a junior sports reporter 
						covering a variety of sports from field hockey to the Equestrian Club.
						The on campus involvement pursuit didn&apos;t stop there as 
						Quinton was then selected as the play-by-play and color 
						commentator for the R-MC baseball team --  a season in which 
						they finished 38-9-1 and lost in the Division III World Series. 
						R-MC hadn&apos;t had a baseball commentator, since Quinton, 
						in recent program history.<br/>
						<img src="images/pic2.JPG" img width="50%" class="pics" align="left" style="margin-right: auto; 
							margin-left:auto; display:block; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 30px;"/><br/>
						&emsp;During summer of 2017 Quinton elected to stay in Ashland, 
						VA, rather than go home to live in Maryland, and intern with 
						WTVR-TV CBS 6 in Richmond, VA. Because the internship was 
						unpaid, and housing on the campus of R-MC cost, Quinton worked 
						part time at Food Lion, as well as continued to produce sports 
						analysis videos via YouTube, in order to pay for rent and food. 
						That summer, Quinton also started the company &quot;Mayo Please,&quot; 
						which features a team of 10 talented aspiring full time journalists 
						contributing written and digital content covering the four major sports leagues.<br/> 
						&emsp;After a grueling summer, school returned to session and 
						Quinton kept the same responsibilities but felt it was necessary 
						to add even more to his plate. He joined the &quot;Locked on Wizards podcast,&quot; 
						in which he quickly put his signature on through extensive 
						basketball comprehension, Washington Wizards knowledge, 
						powerful personality, podcast presence, as well as video 
						and audio editing prowess. If unable to tell so far, 
						Quinton loved the idea of developing the campus of R-MC to 
						assist those who come after him in channeling their love 
						for broadcast journalism. Therefore, he became President 
						of the R-MC radio station, Stinger Radio, and flipped it 
						upside down with new software, shows, music selection, 
						and a new location on campus.<br/>
						<img src="images/pic3.JPG" img width="50%" class="pics" align="left" style="margin-right: auto; 
							margin-left:auto; display:block; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 30px;"/><br/>
						&emsp;The summer of 2018, Quinton became the first student in 
						R-MC history to secure an internship with WJLA ABC 7/News 
						Channel 8 in Arlington, VA. While the internship was 
						unpaid and for academic credit (which is determined by an hour threshold)
						Quinton was so dedicated to the position, and passionate
						about the DMV sports scene, that he completed the hours needed 
						in month one. For the next two months he continued volunteering
						at the same rate, because there was nothing else in the world 
						he&apos;d rather do. Duh. Quinton completed interviews and 
						participated in introductory press conferences with
						Dwight Howard, Troy Brown Jr., Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, 
						Scott Brooks, Ernie Grunfeld, Ted Leonsis, Nicklas B&auml;ckstr&ouml;m, 
						Tiger Woods, Todd Reirden, Ricky Fowler, Billy Horschel, 
						Damon Evans, Jay Gruden, and Ryan Kerrigan, Josh Norman, 
						Paul Richardson, Vernon Davis, and many others. <br/>
						&emsp;Senior year, same story. Quinton added another Infinity 
						Stone to his Gauntlet -- the Richmond Times Dispatch. 
						This opportunity gave him another taste of what it&apos;s like 
						to meet deadlines, search for stories, work effectively 
						in an office setting, multi-task, and produce compelling 
						and informative content -- all skills in which he currently 
						holds and is continuously mastering every single day. 
						At the end of his senior year, Quinton released a video 
						focusing on the perspective of Wizards fans, which went 
						viral on Twitter. The video found the right set of eyes 
						and NBC Sports Washington brought him onto the digital team.<br/>
						<img src="images/pic4.JPG" img width="50%" class="pics" align="left" style="margin-right: auto; 
							margin-left:auto; display:block; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 30px;"/><br/>
						&emsp;Quinton&apos;s first few months at NBC Sports Washington were 
						spent as a digital producer. This job included a multitude 
						of responsibilities such as writing and editing articles, 
						managing social media accounts, optimizing content for the website 
						as well as the app, and mining stories. With the Washington 
						Wizards season quickly approaching, the company was looking 
						for a host, alongside Travis Thomas, that shared a passion 
						and knowledge for basketball, as well as camera presence 
						and charisma. On October 2nd, NBC Sports Washington and the 
						Washington Wizards announced Thomas and 
						Mayo as the hosts of Wizards Outsiders. <br/>
						&emsp;In this current role Quinton hosts the pregame show 
						&quot;Wizards Outsiders,&quot;, and postgame show &quot;Wizards Talk,&quot; 
						as well as the Wizards Talk podcast. Every game, 
						Quinton breaks down every play and creates a package 
						for every fan to receive quality analysis of why the 
						Wizards won or lost. Oh, and it&apos;s without saying Quinton 
						takes you on a roller coaster of emotions while watching. 
						No matter the background, interest, or situation, Quinton 
						connects to the fans in a way that not many anchors can. 
						With his first five months of television experience under 
						his belt, it&apos;s fair to say that if he&apos;s already &quot;good,&quot; 
						great is on the horizon. </p>
